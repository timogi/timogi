ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @timogi, a Data Engineer with a Master of Science in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology who is passionate about computer vision, convolutional neural networks and mobile app development. I have a wide range of experience in these fields and have published several mobile apps on the App Store and Google Play Store.

On my profile, you will find a variety of projects that showcase my abilities. You can also check out my portfolio on my website [timogi.ch](https://timogi.ch/) where I present several of my projects. From bioinformatics tools to computer vision applications and mobile apps. One of my recent projects is a computer vision application that uses convolutional neural networks for object detection. You can read more about this project [here](https://timogi.ch/master-thesis).

Some of the notable contributions are:
